            <p class="flow-text" style="font-family: 'Krub', sans-serif;font-weight: 300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cellphones,
              while only becoming popular and mainstream in the last two decades, have warped society and
              driven individuals into a life of solitude and lack of conversational capability. This issue didnâ€™t fully
              prevent itself until the conception of the first mainstream smartphone in 2007, the iPhone 2G. This new
              piece of hardware allowed people to browse the web, text and call, and listen to music all in one simple
              package. This allowed people to escape reality like never before. At one point in time, people had to
              talk with other while at the gym or on public transport, but now people could put in music or wath videos
              and movies to suspend this vital human interaction. In schools, phones allowed for students to play games
              or listen to music while their teachers are giving lessons causing students to lose interest and stop
              listening all together. Kids in this generation are growing up without having to learn as many vital
              conversation skills that will be necessary in jobs and almost everything else in their life.

              on our bodies at all times also pose the threat of being monitored by the companies selling them
              and even the government. Since our phones have microphone, GPS, and camera modules, they have the
              capability of keeping tabs on citizens at all times. With the growing viability of artificial
              intelligence and machine learning it would be relitively east to set up computers that sift through audio
              and camera footage looking for patterns and notifieng the government or compiling a profile based on
              habits. If the wrong company decided to partner with the US government or even a foreign government,
              there could be someone monitoring us at any time. With these devices becoming irreplacible parts of our
              everydayt life, nothing we do could be personal, there could be someone on the other side at any point in
              time. Even hackers could use this technology to monitor potential targets. These cellular devices have
              become to much of a part of our lives that we need to destroy the hold they have over us and keep us from
              being monitored everywhere we go.
